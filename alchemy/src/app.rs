//! This module implements the Application structure and associated
//! lifecycle methods. You typically never create this struct yourself;
//! in Alchemy, there's a global `shared_app` that you should use to work
//! with the `App` struct.
//!
//! This ensures that you can respond to application lifecycles, and so
//! routing things around works correctly.
